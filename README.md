Leaflet is an app that makes it easy to create and share delightful documents on the web.

You can use Leaflet for things like:

- simple shared notes
- lists and collections
- notebooks or wikis
- homepages
- recipes, manifestos, travel guides and more…

It's a fast web app, fully collaborative, with no accounts and simple sharing / publishing. At its core is a rich block-based editor and a way to add as many pages as you need.
